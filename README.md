# Lazybeard

Lazybeard is an educational project exploring cheat development concepts while following Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) naming conventions. This repository is intended for learning purposes and does **not provide a complete cheat**. Certain parts are intentionally omitted to prevent misuse. More modules and educational examples will be added over time.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is strictly for **educational purposes**. It is designed to help developers understand:  
- Game memory structures  
- Cheat architecture concepts  
- Coding patterns commonly used in game development  

**Lazybeard is not a tool for cheating in games.** Attempting to use it for malicious purposes violates game terms of service and can lead to bans or legal consequences.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Lazybeard is designed as a **learning tool** rather than something to be directly copied or used in games. The goal is to study coding patterns, game structures, and module interactions safely.
